Contributing to pandas
======================

Whether you are a novice or experienced software developer, all contributions and suggestions are welcome!

Our main contribution docs can be found [here](https://github.com/sw1001/ENLP-Project/tree/master/report), but if you do not want to read it in its entirety, we will summarize the main ways in which you can contribute and point to relevant places in the docs for further information.

Getting Started
---------------
If you are looking to contribute to the *ENLP Project* codebase, the best place to start is the [GitHub "issues" tab](https://github.com/sw1001/ENLP-Project/issues). This is also a great place for filing bug reports and making suggestions for ways in which we can improve the code and documentation.

If you have additional questions, feel free to ask them on the [authors list](https://github.com/sw1001/ENLP-Project#authors). Further information can also be found in our [Getting Started](https://github.com/sw1001/ENLP-Project#getting-started) section of our main contribution doc.

Filing Issues
-------------
If you notice a bug in the code or in docs or have suggestions for how we can improve either, feel free to create an issue on the [GitHub "issues" tab](https://github.com/sw1001/ENLP-Project/issues) using [GitHub's "issue" form](https://github.com/sw1001/ENLP-Project/issues/new). The form contains some questions that will help us best address your issue. For more information regarding how to file issues against *pandas*, please refer to the [Bug reports and enhancement requests](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/master/doc/source/contributing.rst#bug-reports-and-enhancement-requests) section of our main contribution doc.

Contributing to the Codebase
----------------------------
The code is hosted on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/sw1001/ENLP-Project), so you will need to use [Git](http://git-scm.com/) to clone the project and make changes to the codebase. 
Once you have obtained a copy of the code, you should create a development environment that is separate from your existing Python environment so that you can make and test changes without compromising your own work environment. 
For more information, please refer to our [Working with the code](https://github.com/sw1001/ENLP-Project/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) section of our main contribution docs.

Before submitting your changes for review, make sure to check that your changes do not break any tests.

Once your changes are ready to be submitted, make sure to push your changes to GitHub before creating a pull request. 
Details about how to do that can be found in the Contributing your changes to ENLP Project section of our main contribution docs. 
We will review your changes, and you will most likely be asked to make additional changes before it is finally ready to merge. 
However, once it's ready, we will merge it, and you will have successfully contributed to the codebase!
